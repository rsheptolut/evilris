Pet Tetris V1.3 by Tim Howe, March 2010.

This is probably the last game EVER to be written for the PET!
It is 30% assembly code and 70% C, and has been compiled with
cc65. This source code should be available on the /pub/cbm archive
and the cc65 website.

It requires a 40 column machine with BASIC 2 ROMS (i.e. a 2001-N or
3000 series machine). Unfortunately, it does not run under BASIC 4
(4000 series). This may be something that I can rectify in due course.

There are 3 versions available:

tetris - This is the standard version and will run in 16k or more.

8ktetris - This is a cut down version that will run on an 8k machine
(This includes the original PET 2001, provided it has upgraded ROMS.
Screen flicker is quite bad though.)

dactetris - This is the 'mega' version and has real wave-audio sound effects.
To hear them, you will need to connect an 8-bit DAC to the PET USER port.
This version requires a 32k mackine (3032).

Hope you enjoy it,
Tim.
